Learn

At a high level, the structure looks roughly like this:

```
ng-boilerplate/
  |- grunt-tasks/
  |- karma/
  |- src/
  |  |- app/
  |  |  |- <app logic>
  |  |- assets/
  |  |  |- <static files>
  |  |- common/
  |  |  |- <reusable code>
  |  |- less/
  |  |  |- main.less
  |- build.config.js
  |- Gruntfile.js
  |- module.prefix
  |- module.suffix
  |- package.json
```

What follows is a brief description of each entry, but most directories contain
their own `README.md` file with additional documentation, so browse around to
learn more.

- `karma/` - test configuration.
- `src/` - our application sources. [Read more &raquo;](src/README.md)
- `build.config.js` - our customizable build settings.
- `Gruntfile.js` - our build script.
- `module.prefix` and `module.suffix` - our compiled application script is
  wrapped in these, which by default are used to place the application inside a
  self-executing anonymous function to ensure no clashes with other libraries.
- `package.json` - metadata about the app, used by NPM and our build script. Our
  NPM dependencies are listed here.

## Development Setup

### Troubleshooting

#### Error: Cannot find module 'liftup'

If you encounter the error "Cannot find module 'liftup'" when running `grunt compass` or any other grunt task, follow these steps:

1. Run the fix-dependencies script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x fix-dependencies.sh
   ./fix-dependencies.sh
   ```

2. Or install the missing dependencies manually:
   ```bash
   npm install liftup@1.0.0 findup-sync@0.3.0 --save-dev
   ```

3. Make sure you have Ruby and Compass installed:
   ```bash
   # On Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install ruby-full
   sudo gem install compass

   # On macOS
   brew install ruby
   gem install compass
   ```

#### CSS Not Generating Correctly

If the CSS isn't generating correctly, ensure:

1. Ruby and Compass are properly installed
2. The SASS files are in the correct location (src/sass)
3. Run `npm run build:css` to specifically build the CSS
